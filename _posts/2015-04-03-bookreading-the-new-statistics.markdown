<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="alignright wp-image-84 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tnsbookcover.jpg" alt="The New Statistics" width="166" height="249" />I read a wonderful book lately. <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/psy/research/cognitive-and-developmental-psychology/esci" target="_blank">The New Statistic</a> by <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/psy/about/staff/profile?uname=GDCumming">Geoff Cumming</a> is highly recommended for anyone serious about rigorous data analysis.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If you thought your stats class is college was dry at best and confusing at worst, then you are going to find a breath of fresh air in this book. I can best describe the book as a user manual explaining the practical implications of <strong>Statistical Cognition </strong>for day to day practitioners of statistics<strong>. </strong>Statistical Cognition is the study of how we  perceive statistics and probability. It is the study of what we actually feel when we hear something like this: "<em>There is a 30% chance of rain tomorrow".</em></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">The traditional process of statistical data analysis revolves around Null Hypothesis Tests. This is the statistics that most of us studied at school and are familiar with. It works like this: We express hypotheses in terms of a Null (H<sub>0</sub>) and an Alternative (H<span style="font-size:11.25px;line-height:0;">1</span>) statement, and then we try to constructs test statistics that can, or cannot, reject the null hypothesis. The idea is that as more and more tests are done by several different researchers (thus replicating the results), a body of research will emerge that helps us paint a clear picture of the phenomena under study. Say, if the majority of studies find a "statistically significant" effect, then we conclude that there is strong reason to believe the effect exists. This is the cornerstone of Scientific Method that I was taught at school. This is how my grad school advisors (all very successful academics) viewed research and wrote their papers.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Traditional Statistics revolves around Null Hypothesis Significance Tests (NHST). We express hypotheses in terms of a Null (H<sub>0</sub>) and an Alternative (H<span style="font-size:11.25px;line-height:0;">1</span>) statement, and then we try to constructs test statistics that can, or cannot, reject the null hypothesis.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Now, the New Statistics approach (the academic jargon is the New Reformist Movement) gives us a completely different story that the NHST form of thinking. These guys say that NHST is deeply flawed mainly because humans are not really good at understanding probability. We tend to have a lot of cognitive fallacies when it comes to understanding probability. A good example of these fallacies in the context of NHST is known as the <b>Cliff Effect</b>. This refers to a sudden loss of confidence if the p-value is slightly larger than the conventional rejection threshold (.05, or .1), meaning people tend to think the difference between .048 and .052 is greater than the difference between .034 and .038. We are very sensitive to passing the threshold as if there is a cliff right around .05 in everyone's mind!</p>

Seems like humans are very sensitive when p&gt;.05, as if having a mental cliff right around .05!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/psy/research/cognitive-and-developmental-psychology/esci">book</a>. Geoff Cumming is a very prolific author and discusses the same concepts in several other <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/1/7.full.pdf+html">papers</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/mind-your-confidence-interval-how-statistics-skew-research-results-3186">articles</a>. They are all very insightful reading material.</p>
